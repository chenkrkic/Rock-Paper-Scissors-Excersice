Rock Paper Scissors Class Exercise, UC Berkeley Extension

I worked with other two groupmate to try out few steps/ functions. Then we joined bach the class and walked through the whole exercise with the instructor

Let's play Rock Paper Scissors!<br />Refresh to play again!
    
Create an array of the three game choices (Rock, Paper, or Scissors)

Create variables to hold the number of wins, losses, and ties. They start at 0.

var wins = 0;
var losses = 0;
var ties = 0;
for (var i = 0; i < 3; i++)

Randomly choose a choice from the gameChoices array. This is the computer's turn.   

When the game is over, alert the final total to the user. We can use the \n character to make a line break.
